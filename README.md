# porterlib
A 3d model, animation and generalized game ripping library written in Rust.

- ~~15k LOC Rust in one weekend and I don't think they can get any better than this.~~
- This was written primarily for fun as my usual portfolio building project.
- I've been writing Rust professionally for years now, but I had never made game tools in it.~~
- It builds cross platform and arch, on Windows (x64/Arm), Linux (x64/Arm), and macOS (x64/Arm).

It's a really large project now.
